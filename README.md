# Cervical Cancer Risk Classification Analysis
This repository contains code and resources for performing a classification analysis on the Cervical Cancer Risk dataset. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature selection, feature elimination, and model building using Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest techniques. The performance of the classification models will be evaluated using key performance metrics and visualizations such as precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), and the ROC curve.

## Dataset
The Cervical Cancer Risk dataset used in this analysis is a publicly available dataset that contains various demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors associated with cervical cancer. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features. Before starting the analysis, it is assumed that the dataset has been downloaded and saved in a file named "cervical_cancer_dataset.csv".

### Requirements
To run the code and reproduce the analysis, you need the following dependencies:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

## File Descriptions
cervical_cancer_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data cleaning, feature selection, feature elimination, and model building using Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest techniques.

kag_risk_factors_cervical_cancer.csv: The dataset used for the analysis. This file should be placed in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
